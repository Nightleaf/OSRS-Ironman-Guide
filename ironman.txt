Oldschool Runescape
How to efficiently max an ironman
By OzirisRS

Old version: http://pastebin.com/VpEW1XKN
This version is partly copy pasted from the old, with improved quest order and new methods, just in case you're wondering why it looks the exact same at first. 
I did include a few alternate methods however, some are for HCIM and some for slightly more casual playstyle, but keep in mind I made this for the purpose of going towards max total so there might be parts where I tell you to get a 99 in one go. If you don't want to do that then I suggest just reading the guide and trying to work out some parts that you can do while getting that particular 99.

If there's a mistake in this guide somewhere then feel free to tweet me @ozirislol but don't tell me to update this as soon as some new update comes, these take a very long time to make.

Start as a female character, don't forget to make yourself an ironman before leaving tutorial island.

Use every book and lamp on Herblore if possible.

Get rune pouch ASAP, unless you feel like it's cheating to boost bh emblems. I personally don't think there's anything wrong with it as long as you don't start farming them to get alchables on your iron. Tier 6 for a rune pouch.
 
Do gem and maze randoms
 
Authenticator AND 2-step verification on e-mail

	then you might as well use them.
	
	Alternative: If you aren't planning on killing Zulrah for magic logs to get 99 Firemaking, you can do WT until 99 now if you want
	to. You will miss out on a fair bit of supplies for not having higher other skills, but it's not the end of the world. You don't

1.2 Thieving, fishing and mining


Desert
Start the Feud at Ali Morrisane, buy the desert disguise
Smelt the 5 silver, make a sickle and unstrung holy symbol, keep 3 bars
Talk to Osman to get the key for Prince ali rescue quest

Do the Feud, get maple blackjack
	HCIM; Unlock the rune shop also, it's a much safer option than mage bank before mage guild (Although you won't get as many cosmics)

Blackjack until 80 thieving, you can buy wines from the bar to use as food.
	If you've been raising cats so far, I recommend not to while BJing because it gives you a delay when the kitten says it's hungry or
	wants attention. This could cause the bandit to attack you, or even kill you.


Ardy cloak tele and take the spirit tree to Gnome stronghold
	Inv: GP, 2 bird snares, 5 butterfly jars, butterfly net, axe, knife
Go out of the stronghold and walk by the fence to the west and then go north to Piscatoris

Get 29 hunter
	Put your bird snare right here, http://i.imgur.com/hQutEIn.png
	Catch just the 1 bird until level 15, at that point start catching the ruby harvest butterflies, while hunting birds at the same
	time. You can put another bird snare at level 20. Doing this should get you 29hunt in less than 90 minutes.

If you're planning on doing 3-tick skilling, get a full inv of kebbit claws. My preferred spot, http://i.imgur.com/QebW6Yc.png
	Need 32 craft to make spiked vambs, so just make some molten glass. Kill cows for leather since you need 40 range to buy them.


Spirit tree to gnome stronghold and take the glider to Karamja
Go to Shilo Village
Buy 50-100k feathers for now (Or 250k if you know for sure you're doing 99 fishing eventually at barb fish, ~150k if knife 3t method)
Get 58 fishing with trout and salmon

Minigame tele to Barb assault
Get 70 agility from barb fishing, should be around 94 fishing.
	You can feed caviar and roe to kitten if you want death runes, just saves gp so it's not that important.
	Finish 99 fishing after you unlock kingdom, 70 agi and str is all you really need for now

	Alternate method: If you don't want to fish, do priest in peril now and train 52 agility, go to wildy course for 60 and then get
	full graceful and 70 agi at seers course. You don't have to do this all at once of course but you need at least 70 eventually.
	HCIM; Stick to Canifis course until 60 agility
	That being said I HIGHLY recommend fishing at least 50 agi, since you need the higher str level very soon anyway.


After 70 agility
Minigame tele to Burthrope
Do the rogue's den minigame for full rogue outfit. Guide by Lelador, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tQewEZPe4
	You can cook the trout and salmon while you regen run energy for maximum efficiency
	Buy 50 lockpicks while you're here

Equip the set and go back to thieving until around 2.5m GP

	Inv: teleport runes, all the golem quest items

Start the Golem
	START ELEMENTAL WORKSHOP 2 BY READING THE BOOK WHILE AT DIGSITE, keep the items in bank 
Finish The Golem, get the gems with chisel and hammer

Do Shadow of the storm(should have priest gown and black wizard hat in bank as your black items)
    10K REWARD ON RANGED ALWAYS
        If you didn't do fishing for str lvls, this boss fight will take you like +30mins of flinching. In that case probably worth
		leaving this quest for later, or think of some way you can get your melee stats up.


Go to Edgeville and talk to Oziach to continue Dragon slayer
Go to mage bank and buy 6k nats, all of the cosmics you can get and 10 law runes each world
	This might take more than 1 trip. HCIM can buy them from ali morrisane if you don't wanna risk mage bank, although they're more
	expensive.

Teleport to Falador
Finish pirate's treasure quest
Get 2 buckets of sap from this tree near falador east bank, http://i.imgur.com/YoH5z70.png

1.4 Skilling, lots of it

Plant barley seeds at the hops patch north of Seers, pay the farmer 3 normal compost to look after them
 
Do;
The Giant dwarf
Buy emeralds from gem store until log in limit
 
    These next 2 quests have times where you have to wait for stuff to happen, smith iron dart tips while you wait
 
Forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf
    There's an anvil near the bank in keldagrim
    Your barley should be grown when you need it, use it on a range to get the barley malt
 
Garden of tranquility

    While waiting for the willow tree to grow
 
        Do Eyes of glouphrie and Tower of life (Should get you 15 construction, which allows you to make oak stuff in the workshop)
        Smith the rest of your iron dart tips, leave 20 bars for quests

Go to Shilo village
Mine and cut 5 opals/jade/red topaz, doesn't matter which gems as long as you get 5
	Don't mine any more than that since it's slow without a charged glory

Talk to Murcaily to start Tai bwo wannai cleanup minigame and repair 1 part of the fence to be able to cut teaks
Sell the gems to Gabooty in tai bwo wannai for trading sticks
Cut teaks in the grove until 60 woodcutting

Finish Enlightened journey if you didn't already
	Unlock whichever balloon routes you might want to use, I use castle wars -> taverly for tree runs


Finish 99 fishing
	Do farm runs while you fish, at least tree runs if you have seeds from kingdom and the harralander seeds from master farmer.
	If you need a break then feel free to do the construction and hunter parts that are next in the guide.
	Buy the cape, unlimited teles close to a bank


Buy 6 compost packs and get 45% hosidius favor
Finish 100% favor at the mess hall, lock favour by talking to Hosa in the center of Kourend (Need to talk to him twice to lock AFAIK)
	This is also where you can get 80 cooking at any point you want to, it's up to 210k xp/h with pizzas
	Put your house to kourend for herb runs

Go to the woodcutting guild
Cut and make 1700 oak planks
Get 50 construction
	lvl 15, repair bench in the workshop
	lvl 16, crafting table 1 in the workshop
	lvl 22, oak dining table in the dining room
	lvl 33, oak larder in the kitchen
Build oak altar


Get 83 hunter
	29-43 swamp lizards
	43-59 falconry (feel free to do orange sallies if you don't like this, falconry is faster)
	59-67 red salamanders
	67-80 black salamanders
		HCIM; stay at red sallies until 80
	80-83 red chinchompas, surround 1 red chin with your traps and just range it if it wanders off
		If you want to rush a fire cape before any more slayer then stay here until you have around 4500 red chins for 70 range, or
		you could start doing chins at 77 hunter if you want to stop at 83.


Puro-puro
Bring snare and alch runes
Get Magic butterfly net and Jar generator
Find an eclectic impling spawn, do medium clues until you get any kind of yew bow for temple of ikov
 
Go south east corner, catch nature/magpie/ninja/dragon impling, hop and do the same in another world
	Hold 3 worlds and catch the rare implings as they spawn
	You can add a 4th world when you get better at it
Do this until 12 magic logs from the nature implings
	Don't bother getting a glory from dragons, you'll be doing 80 craft soon anyway. The 83 hunter is mainly for those random D imps.
	If you do happen to get lucky then mount a glory in your house, don't bother using charged glories if you only have 2.


Do Temple of Ikov quest
	Start fletching iron darts while you run around doing quests
Do the Regicide quest
	Pick up a few whiteberries just north of the elf tracker

If you have enough sand and soda ash, make molten glass until 46 crafting and then blow them into orbs for 49 craft
	If you don't have enough then go buy them now at Catherby (most likely more in stock than khazard)
Do Hand in the sand quest, get daily sand every day

Do these quests while fletching darts:
	Big chompy bird hunt
	Rag and bone man (first part)
	Family crest
	Start Legend's quest (for RFD. You can finish this whenever you want, I probably won't give it a special mention later)
	Death plateau
	Troll Stronghold


I'll assume you have fletched everything now and have 53 fletching
	It depends how many days have passed since you unlocked kingdom, but I'd guess you have around 8k maples now
Fletch maple shortbows (u) until 55 fletching
Fletch all of your maple logs into maple longbows (u)
	If you want to be as efficient as possible, buy craft supplies and fletch to regen run energy

Buy same amount of nats (from mage bank, get cosmics too) as maple longs(u) and alch them while doing agility
	HCIM; don't buy too many at once if you're buying from Ali since you can go buy them from mage guild for cheaper at 63 mage.
Do agility until full graceful, switch to Rellekka at 80 agility
	Loot kingdom and fletch more longbows to alch if you run out. Finish graceful even if you don't have enough alchs.

Guessing you have 81 agility and around 70 mage now, the goal is 77 for superglass make. 
Keep alching maple (u)'s while you do farm runs and quests

Do all of the RFD subquests, except the awowogei part
Buy a bunch of chocolate dust from the chest and make energy pots
Do Monkey madness, focus reward on attack and defense 
Awowogei sub quest (70 cooking at the Hosidius mess hall if you forgot where to get it)


Get crafting supplies for 61 crafting
	From 49 you need 2920 buckets of sand and soda ash (58.4k from making molten glass and 153.3k from blowing orbs)
	You can save the seaweed for later and just buy the supplies until 2.9k buckets and ash, or you can cook the seaweed and fill sand
	manually. If you fill sand, put your house to yanille and bank with fishing cape. Set house tele to outside.
Get 61 craft
	If you bought your nats at mage bank and got some cosmics, you can charge fire orbs for later while you craft orbs. House to 
	Taverly and bank with dueling rings or fish cape. Rune pouch is extremely helpful for this.





1.5 Diaries and finishing RFD




Buy 2.2k gold ore from Blast furnace shop and get 60 smithing
	You need to pay the foreman 10k every now and then when below 60
Make a mithril grapple

Do Watchtower quest
Do Ardy medium diaries, start getting daily ess. 
	100 might not seem like much but it adds up, always buy sapphires and emeralds and thieve stall while you go get it daily.


Do these quests for QP and diaries:
Icthlarin's little helper
Eagles' peak
Enakhra's lament
Rat catchers
Olaf's quest
Between a rock
Tai bwo wannai trio
Rum deal & Cabin fever (Req 42 slayer, if you got a wild pie from eclectics then do this, if not then leave morytania medium for later)
A soul's bane
One small favour

Do all easy and medium diaries
	Wildy requires 50slayer, leave that for when you go back to slayer.
	Buy cosmics from mage bank for now to charge orbs for daily staffs
		4k cosmics is enough to last until you can get 59 rc


Do Eadgar's ruse
Do My arm's big adventure
Do Desert Treasure

Finish RFD, buy B gloves
	Here's a video of me killing the bosses with low stats if you've never done it before, not too difficult:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07I5GnMcVTc





2. Goals after Barrows gloves


Buy a dragon battleaxe and dragon scimitar
Thieve master farmers every time you're out of seeds, helps so much later on to unlock staminas faster

Get 60 mining and do Lunar's diplomacy
Do Magic training arena for bones to peaches (diary req) and infinity boots. Should get you 77 magic if you've been alching maples
Get 80 crafting
	Go to any charter boat, buy 10 sand and 10 seaweed, use superglass make, craft them into lantern lenses and sell them back.
	Iron DVS shows this on video, https://youtu.be/-Y-AJkcoEEg?t=209
	As for orbs to make battlestaffs, just get daily sand, buy seaweed/soda ash and that should cover it
Make at least 2 glories, put one in your house. Make a ring of wealth to use during slayer
	HCIM might wanna use ring of life, although wealth makes shield left half a lot more common.

Do Pest control for full range void in the intermediate boat, train at least 55 range with a bone crossbow at PC
Use your chins at monkey madness 1 tunnels on the skeletons
	Some people like to wait until MM2, but I don't think that's worth since your DBA spec boosts str more when your other combat stats 
	are higher. Get the holy wrench before you chin

Get a fire cape as soon as you think you can do it
	At 70 range you use 8 charges of crystal bow without range pots, flicking eagle eye
Get a fighter torso from BA
Get a dragon defender
	Finish 60 attack first if you didn't get from 40 slayer, then straight to 60 defense

Read the rest of the guide so you'll know what's coming


Start slaying. Plenty of garbage tasks early on, but just gotta deal with them.

Train 70 attack -> 70 defence -> 80 strength -> 75 attack -> 99 strength -> 90 attack and then controlled for the rest of your life. Don't train defence with a whip since you'll get a lot of xp with defensive cast when maging.
Pray flick everything, except maybe aberrant spectres


Prioritize slayer points on; 
Blocks* > Superior slayer > Slayer ring unlock > Blocks* > Herb sack/Slayer helm > Broads/Garg finisher > Extensions
	*Read the block list


Use Nieve until 87 Slayer
Nieve Block/Skip list

Block:
Suqah 			(Block these asap, you don't want to do these ever, skip if you can't block)
Black demon 	(Same as above, not a good task on ironman no matter what anyone might tell you, skip if no points to block)
Kalphite 		(Block after superiors and rings, you can kill the low lvls for fast points)
Hellhound 		(Block after superiors and rings, do them if you don't have 100pts, not worth skipping)
Fire giant		(If you like these then block spiritual creatures instead, need 250QP for 5th block)

You shouldn't be using Nieve anymore when you've done lumby elite for the 6th block
	However if you want to stick with Nieve then block trolls(or spiritual creature if you didn't block fire giant)

Skip:
Cave Kraken
Trolls (do these until you've got a few hundred points to work with)
Cave horror (until blowpipe, I personally do them even with melee but most people seem to not like them)
Iron dragon
Steel dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth (Do these until you get a whip, the leaf sword isn't THAT bad compared to dscim, worth losing a few max hits for the herbs)
Mutated zygomites (you can do these for points if you want, i cba)
Waterfiends

Tasks you should do:
Abyssal demon 	(preference whether you mage or melee them, after morytania elite I'd recommend melee at slay tower)
Bloodveld*		(Melee in catacombs, really nice xp/h for a melee task)
Dagannoth 		(Catacombs. After Zulrah you can do them at lighthouse like this: https://youtu.be/IIHCAZ7v4Lw?t=201 )
Greater demons 	(Melee at catacombs for shards and heads)
Fire giant 		(Catacombs. Before you get a 5th block, not that great but not the worst task)
Nechryael* 		(Best task on ironman right now IMO, melee with arclight in nieve's cave and tower after morytania elite)
		The only reason you'd mage nechs is to rush 99 magic, other than that the slay xp/h doesn't even get close to being worth doing
		and losing so much herblore xp from normal nechs.
Smoke devil 	(Shouldn't be using Nieve still but I'll list this anyway, barrage them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn98NVrna0U )
Spectres* 		(Melee at tower after you get slay rings, faster to get to than Nieves cave. Kill with BP after Zulrah)
Black dragon 	(kill babies for points, bank bones)
Dust devil*		(Burst/barrage in catacombs)
Gargoyle*		(Melee in nieve's cave. Tower is most likely crowded so might be worth doing at nieve's even after morytania elite)
Ankou			(Skip these if you want to. Melee in catacombs, can burst these but idk if it's even worth. Fast task anyway)
Dark beast		(Fast points)
Wyvern**		(Can 1 trip, chance of visage and some decent supplies)
Blue dragons	(Melee. For overall efficiency blue drags on task are better than green drags off task)
Elves			(Melee at elf camp, run from Lletya. Honestly you can skip these if you don't like them, decent seeds/heads tho)
Kurask			(Good supplies. Think they're worth doing even if they're a bit lower xp/h since you're using leaf sword)

*Extended
** If you want you can extend wyverns, but do it only after 90+ attack and str



If you want, get mages' book now. I doubt it saves more time that actually getting it but if you plan on doing any post max stuff with it, then it's better to get it early rather than later. You do get a decent chunk of mage xp so you'll be able to farm with lunars earlier if you do get it.

Get 58 slayer and camp for a black mask, do clues for black dhide
Do Slayer until level 70

If you're fletching maples for some afk time, stop making longbows at around 75 fletching and make arrow shafts instead
	Need around 1.1m arrow shafts(18.3k maple logs) to finish 99fletching
	The whole process of making headless arrows is roughly 180k xp/h even if you just bankstand, so a lot better than maple longs

Regular ironman:
Get 67 construction (or higher if you don't want to +5) with this method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o
Make a gilded altar
Kill green dragons for 70 prayer, ~2k bones including the ensouled heads you've got so far from slayer
	Use loot bag and bank hides also, make dhide bodies
Unlock piety

HCIM:
Get 67 construction (or higher if you don't want to +5) with this method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o
Use the ensouled heads and dragon bones from blue dragons to get 60 prayer
Unlock chivalry
You'll get piety from slaying at around 82 slayer, not worth risking green drags IMO


Get a quest cape
Go back to slayer
Do hard diaries as soon as you can do them, should have all of them done at 80 slayer
	Ardy hard RC req might take until around 85 slayer
	Get 59 rc at either ZMI or lavas and from there just get 65 with cosmics
		Lavas are slightly more efficient at lower levels, and even at higher if you're good at lava rcing

Get 85 slayer
Abby demons are the most common task from Nieve, I'd recommend getting a whip on task but that's up to you. Use arclight
Get 73 herblore and make at least 1 inv of staminas with botanical pie
Make a pool of revitalisation in your house, good for herb runs so you don't need any energy pots

Get 87 slayer
Switch your kingdom to teaks or mahogany instead of maples if you have enough logs for the 1.1m arrow shafts, which I mentioned earlier
	Teaks are a bit slower construction xp/h but cheaper, completely your preference on which one you want





3. Zulrah, slayer and diary cape


Switch to Duradel, use karamja gloves 3 or npc contact for new task

Duradel Block/Skip list

Block:
Suqah 			
Black demon 	
Kalphite 		
Hellhound 		
Cave kraken		(Keep fire giants blocked until you get a trident and tentacle)
Greater demon	(6th block after lumby elite)	


Skip:
Spiritual creatures
Fire giant
Steel dragon
Trolls
Ankou
Iron dragon
Scabarites
Brine rats
Turoth
Mutated zygomites
Waterfiends
Kurask			(xp/h starting to fall off way too hard compared to the other tasks)

Tasks you should do:
Abyssal demon
Dark beast		(Fast points)
Tzhaar			(Jad, unlock the task when you get a blowpipe) 	
Black dragon
Dagannoth 		( Serp helm and BP, https://youtu.be/IIHCAZ7v4Lw?t=201 ) 
Greater demons 	(Do until 6th block)
Nechryael*
Smoke devil 	( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn98NVrna0U ) 		
Bloodveld*
Gargoyle*
Spectres* 		(Kill with BP)	
Wyvern**			
Dust devil*		(Burst/barrage in catacombs)	
Blue dragons	(Melee. For overall efficiency blue drags on task are better than green drags off task)
Cave horror 	(Do with blowpipe, worth it for heads and seeds. That said, you profit a lot of slay pts so you can skip if want to)
Elves			(Melee at elf camp, run from Lletya. Honestly you can skip these if you don't like them, decent seeds/heads tho)

*Extended
** If you want you can extend wyverns, but do it only after 90+ attack and str



Continue with slayer until you get a trident, kill the small ones

After trident:
	Get 85 crafting and make a fury, 29k chaos runes for the tokkul, don't forget karamja gloves for cheaper onyx
	Get 99 hunter at the private red chin area
	Chin 99 range at MM2 tunnels


Kill Zulrah until you get a blowpipe (HCIM might want to wait until 93 slayer for the revive)
	Use mystic and void range
	Recommend using cure-me spell rather than antipoisons, doubt you can get antivenoms yet.
		If you get a serp helm, you can switch to using it with black dhide


Do barrows until full set for morytania elite
Firemake all of the magic logs from zulrah
	If you didn't get quite enough for 80 then just boost it
Do morytania elite diary

Get 77 herblore
Do some agility for marks of grace
Make staminas


Get at least 83 smithing for lumby elite
Get at least 71 RC, should have it banked unless you got really lucky on blowpipe
Do Lumby elite diary



Back to Slayer

Unlock Jad tasks
All of this PVM stuff can be skipped if you don't feel like getting those items. If you just want to rush max total then I wouldn't get these items, they're more for post 99 stuff and to look fancy.

	Unblock black demon and get at least 3 zenytes to make anguish, tormented bracelet and ring of suffering

Before you block greater demons, I recommend getting a hasta from Zammy GWD for
	KQ (KQ head for desert diary)
	Cerb (primordials and eternals) Unblock hellhound after hasta if you want to do Cerb
	Vetion (D pick, could do other bosses, but I think this is the fastest unless you got veracs)

Do DKS on task for B ring, archers ring, seers ring, mud battlestaff and D axe
	If you're close to banking 77 rc for fremennik elite diary, then you may want to get that before DKS

Do slayer until 93
	Remember to keep farming at least fruit trees, should have a decent amount of seeds from zulrah
	You can save your magic seeds to plant them at fally after elite diary, but farming shouldn't be a problem even if some of them die

After 93 slayer and occult necklace
	Do barrows for full dharoks, kill 3-4k mole
		You can leave some of them for later if you don't want to kill that many at once
	Get 87 herblore for antivenoms
	Get 2k zulrah kc
	Do all elite diaries
		If you can't afford both fletching and smithing yet, then just do smithing and do desert diary later


Get 99 slayer




4. Finishing max total


If you've been slacking on herb runs, now is really when you have to start doing as many of them as possible, or you'll have nothing to do while you farm herbs

At the time of writing this guide, I don't know exactly how much herblore xp you get from 99 slayer nowadays, but I'd guess you need to do a total of 3m thieving xp at master farmers for seeds
	Instead of master farmers you can do another 3-4k zulrah if you want to, which would be slightly more efficient. I went with 4k in
	this guide because not everyone has the patience to kill 8k zulrah, so these methods are more for the majority

Start collecting 4k poison ivy berries and 4k nightshades to make weapon poison++ with all of your coconuts
	For nightshade, put house in yanille, go out from west gates, go south and it's the first cave you see
	Pick up 14 and then do something else for at least 5 minutes
		Need skavid map and lightsource
	Poison ivy berries you can collect every herb run
	
Finish 4k zulrah kc
	Should be enough supplies for 99fm, farming and cooking
	You can decide yourself if you want to use addy bars to make darts or plates
	Use the rune bars at 98 smithing to make rune legs, buy like 100 dwarven stouts from burthorpe bar


Do these 99's in any order you want to
	Fletching
	Firemaking
	Farming
	Cooking
	Mining
	Smithing
	Prayer
	Runecrafting (Finish 99 with souls after you've used all of your ess)
		Do RC after crafting cape if you want to do lavas instead of ZMI

After those I would finish the rest in this order
	Crafting (spin flax from zulrah if you can afford to buy the runes)
	Herblore
	Agility
	Woodcutting (Bank enough teaks for 99 construct, use ape atoll tele on arceus spellbook and crafting cape)
	Construction
