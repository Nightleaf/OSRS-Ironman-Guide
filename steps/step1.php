<h3>Let's Begin!</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start as a female character.</li>
<p>This guide assumes that you always carry your cash stack, unless I say not to bring it. &nbsp;I will mention to bring gp regardless most of the time, but if I don't then keep it on you anyway.</p>
    <li>Use every book and lamp on Herblore if possible.</li>
    <li><p>Get rune pouch ASAP, unless you feel like it's cheating to boost bh emblems. I personally don't think there's anything wrong with it as long as you don't start farming them to get alchables on your iron. Tier 6 for a rune pouch.</p></li>
    <li><p>Do gem and maze randoms.</p></li> 
    <li><p>Setup authenticator AND 2-step verification on e-mail!</p></li>
</ol>
